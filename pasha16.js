Your implementation of the transitionPoint function looks correct! It efficiently uses binary search to find the transition point where 0 
transitions to 1 in the sorted array of 0s and 1s. The logic for updating low and high pointers based on the comparison with the mid element
is accurate.

The provided examples produce the expected output. If you have any further questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or 
improve, feel free to let me know!
